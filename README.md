👋 Hi, I’m @JJTropie25
👀 I’m interested in space engineering, particularly in satellite control systems, space mission design, and orbit dynamics.
🌱 I’m currently working on my Master’s thesis, which focuses on the rendezvous design and attitude control of an on-orbit servicing satellite.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on space-related projects, especially those involving satellite control, mission design, and estimation algorithms.
📫 How to reach me: You can email me at pietro.costantini@mail.polimi.it or connect with me on LinkedIn.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I’m passionate about cycling and I’m working on setting up an online cycling shop where people can buy and sell new or used gear!
